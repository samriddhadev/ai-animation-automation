# **Motion from Stills – Summary**

You are exploring ways to turn still images into motion pictures, beyond classic Ken Burns and parallax techniques. The approaches span **cinematic illusions**, **stylized transitions**, **AI-powered animation**, **pose/face animation**, and **elemental FX integration**.

---

## **1. Cinematic Illusion Techniques**

* **Cinemagraphs:** Subtle motion in elements like water or hair.
* **Particle overlays:** Moving rain, snow, dust, sparks, or light leaks.
* **Depth camera projection (2.5D):** Simulated camera moves using depth maps.
* **Light sweeps & shadows:** Animate light over static images.

---

## **2. Stylized Motion**

* Morphing between images.
* Stylized transitions: wipes, glitches, fractal zooms.
* Elemental FX compositing.

---

## **3. AI-Powered Motion**

* **Frame interpolation / motion hallucination:** EbSynth, Deforum (Stable Diffusion).
* **Depth-aware video generation:** Stable Video Diffusion (SVD).
* **Pose / face animation:** Wav2Lip, First Order Motion Model (FOMM), DID, HeyGen.
* **Style-motion loops:** Neural style transfer frame-by-frame.

---

## **4. Pose / Face Animation**

* **Wav2Lip:** Lip-sync animation from audio.
* **FOMM (First Order Motion Model):** Animate a still face/body using a driver video.
* **Full-body pose animation:** OpenPose or MediaPipe skeleton extraction driving motion.

**GPU requirements:**

* Wav2Lip works on CPU but slow; recommended GPU 4–8 GB VRAM (GTX 1050 Ti minimum).
* Higher-end GPUs accelerate inference significantly.

---

## **5. Elemental FX Integration**

* **Overlay approach:** Blend videos of effects (rain, smoke, sparks) over stills.
* **Particle systems:** Procedural smoke, fire, sparks using Blender or Pygame.
* **AI-generated effects:** Stable Diffusion inpainting, ControlNet, Runway ML.
* **Tips for realism:** Match lighting, depth, occlusion, motion, and optionally sound.

If you want, I can also **draw a visual workflow diagram** that shows how **stills → depth/pose → AI / FX → final motion** could be standardized.

Do you want me to create that diagram?
